# DataView

The goal of this project is produce a platform which displays real-time data about the most recent information and statistics about common products. Currently, the project is only incorporating data about cars.


(This project was the final project for CS196, which was submitted on the class github, which I do not have admin
rights to. Thus, this repository is a cloned version of that one, and that is why there are no commits visible.
Please contact me if you would like to see the commit history)
