# graphs-from-csv
The goal of this project is produce a platform which displays real-time data about the most recent information and statistics about common products. Currently, the project is only incorporating data about cars.

An example repository for creating website graphs from CSV files. This repository uses c3.js and PapaParse.

### Graph/Chart Library
c3.js: http://c3js.org/

### CSV/JSON Parsing Library
PapaParse: http://papaparse.com/

### Only Requirement
You need a web server. I used python to initiate a web server.

```
python --version
Python 2.7.10
```

```
cd graphs-from-csv/
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Visit http://localhost:8913 to see the website.

(This project was the final project for CS196, which was submitted on the class github, which I do not have admin rights to. Thus, this repository is a cloned version of that one, and that is why there are no commits visible. Please contact me if you would like to see the commit history)
